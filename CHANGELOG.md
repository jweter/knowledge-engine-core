# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added the `ke corpus-import` CLI command for persisted, local-only corpus imports.
- Added pre-persistence duplicate evidence decisions with exact-duplicate skipping and
  probable-match review outcomes.
- Added linked resume and retry behavior with explicit execution and review statuses.
- Added provenance-preserving metadata preview and Crossref enrichment boundaries.
- Added a controlled 100-paper rehearsal report and deterministic scale-readiness
  assessment for the next bounded corpus rehearsal.
- Added typed expected parser and duplicate-resolution failure contracts.
- Added the controlled 500-paper rehearsal report (M14, issue #21): a fresh
  import and a linked resume against the same manifest snapshot both reconciled
  exactly with zero failures, zero issues, and a fully idempotent resume,
  yielding a `PROCEED` decision.
- Added `docs/phase2_design.md`, the implementation-ready Phase 2 design
  (mirroring `docs/phase1_design.md`'s role for Phase 1): architecture,
  extraction-record schema reuse, testing strategy, and open questions for
  automated claim/evidence extraction.
- Added the M15 Phase 2 foundation (issue #89): page/span-level extraction
  provenance. `PyMuPDFParser` now normalizes text per page and
  `ParsedPaper.pages` preserves page boundaries a document-level join used to
  discard; a new `paper_pages` table persists this so a future extracted claim
  can cite an exact `(page_number, offset)` span instead of only a page count.
  `ke evidence-validate` now validates `source_span`'s shape and requires a
  non-empty `extraction_status`, and `ke evidence`/`ke answer --evidence`/
  `ke evidence-report` display each record's real `extraction_method` instead
  of a hardcoded manual label.
- Added the M16 deterministic structured-section detection (issue #91):
  `knowledge_engine.extraction.detect_sections` locates methods/results/
  limitations-style IMRAD sections within a paper's parsed pages by
  conservative heading-pattern matching (no new dependency, no statistical
  model), returning page/offset-bounded `SectionSpan` records. Sections may
  span multiple pages. A paper with no recognizable headings simply produces
  zero sections rather than a guessed default. Not yet wired into any CLI
  command or evidence-record generation -- claim extraction against these
  spans is a later milestone.
- Added the M17 deterministic claim-candidate sentence detection (issue #94):
  `knowledge_engine.extraction.detect_claim_candidates` locates candidate
  claim sentences within a paper's `results`/`conclusion` sections (from M16)
  by conservative signal matching -- a percentage, p-value, confidence
  interval, or explicit comparative phrase -- using a deterministic,
  abbreviation-aware sentence splitter (no new dependency, no statistical
  model). A sentence with no such signal is never treated as a candidate.
  Stops short of PICO extraction, evidence-direction classification, and
  `EvidenceRecord` generation, which remain later milestones.

### Changed

- Made Ruff the authoritative formatter and linter used by both developer commands
  and GitHub Actions.
- Unexpected parser and duplicate-resolution exceptions now propagate as systemic
  failures instead of being persisted as ordinary per-paper issue codes.
- Reconciled README, roadmap, and technical-debt documentation through M13 and named
  the controlled 500-paper rehearsal as the next bounded milestone.
- Migrated M14 PMC OA discovery and acquisition off the PMC OA Web Service API
  (`oa.fcgi`) and the PMC FTP Service, both of which NCBI is removing entirely in
  August 2026, onto NCBI's documented PMC Article Datasets Cloud Service (a public,
  world-readable S3 bucket reachable via ordinary unsigned HTTPS — no new
  dependency). This is a durable replacement, done ahead of the removal date,
  superseding the temporary `/pub/pmc/deprecated/` bridge added previously. See
  `docs/architecture/adr/0004-migrate-pmc-oa-acquisition-to-cloud-service.md`.
  Bumped the M14 adjudication ruleset to `m14-candidate-adjudication-v4` since the
  accepted PDF-URL host changed.
- Reconciled README documentation through M17: current phase, milestone history,
  and known issues now reflect Phase 2 progress (page/span provenance, structured-
  section detection, claim-candidate detection) instead of stopping at M14.

### Fixed

- Fixed M14 bounded PubMed/PMC discovery retrying NCBI failures (including PMC
  identifier conversion) with only the steady-state request pacing interval instead
  of a real backoff; retries now use exponential backoff and failure messages
  include the HTTP status code for diagnosability.
- Fixed M14 PMC OA acquisition failing on every PDF request because NCBI relocated
  its legacy PMC FTP paths ahead of removing them in August 2026; acquisition now
  retries once against NCBI's confirmed `/pub/pmc/deprecated/` relocation, and
  failures now report the HTTP status code and failing approval for diagnosability.
- Fixed the `Quality` GitHub Actions gate silently reporting success even when lint,
  type-check, or tests failed, because piping through `tee` without `set -o
  pipefail` swallowed the real tool exit code. Also fixed every pre-existing lint
  finding, mypy error, and test failure the corrected gate now enforces, including
  a third and fourth occurrence of the single-command Typer CLI collapse bug
  (`pdf_calibration_cli.py`, `candidate_review_cli.py`) and a real SQLite backup
  bug where a naive (non-timezone-aware) timestamp left a partial, unverified
  snapshot file on disk instead of being cleaned up.
- Fixed M14 candidate adjudication accepting restricted `CC BY-NC`, `CC BY-NC-ND`,
  and `CC BY-NC-SA` licenses as if they were the fully-reusable `CC BY` license,
  because the license check used a string-prefix match instead of an exact match.
  Restricted licenses are now correctly held instead of accepted.
- Fixed M14 manifest curation leaving `license_url` and `access_date` blank and
  `expected_content_hash` unprefixed, which caused every exported row to fail
  corpus-import validation. `license_url` is now derived deterministically from
  `license_type`, `access_date` from the adjudication timestamp, and the hash is
  now written with its required `sha256:` prefix.
- Fixed the allowed-license version pattern matching any digits-and-dots string
  (e.g. `CC0 2.0`, a version that was never published) instead of a real
  Creative Commons version, which could let malformed license evidence pass
  adjudication and produce a license URL with no real deed behind it.
- Fixed `migrate_schema` verifying that every table registered in the ORM
  metadata already exists *before* creating newly-registered tables, for any
  database past schema version 0 — a table introduced by a new schema version
  (like this release's `paper_pages`) could never actually migrate onto an
  existing database; it would always raise instead. Fixed by only exempting
  tables introduced at a version newer than the database's own recorded
  version from the pre-creation check, so a genuinely new table is created
  silently while a table that was actually dropped or corrupted from an
  already-reached version still raises rather than being silently recreated
  empty.
